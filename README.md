1.4: Fourth Update to the Site, Added Intro Loader Animation while the Page loads and Animated some Elements on Scroll.

1.5: Fifth Update to the Site, A Huge Update, where I changed the Form Submission Request from Formspree to a better and convenient option which doesn't even need a server or backend to be used. There is also an AJAX Response when a Form is Submitted (So No Redirects) and Spam prevention is (hopefully) there too. Finally, I deleted the Local Saved Font Awesome Folder and instead added an External Link in my HTML.

1.6: Sixth Update to the Site, I changed the Layout of the 'Some Skills' section from stacking horizontally to stacking vertically of the icons. Changed the text of the 'About' section and made it more professional. Finally, I added few more social links on the Footer.

1.7: Seventh and a small update, I added a "Last Updated" section at the bottom of the page and made the year at the footer change automatically.

1.8: Eigth and a critical update, I fixed the navigational buttons not-working-at-all issue.

2.0: A **Huge** update, where I rebuilt and redesigned the site from the grounds up, it includes many bug fixes, a whole new navigation with lesser code than the previous template one (I wrote it myself this time), more minimalist sections, lesser code overall (got rid of nearly 450 lines of CSS), better and minimal footer, overall better color combination throughout the site, removed lot of local JS files and linked CDN links instead, removing and adding different JS libraries and more...

2.1: Just a small update, added my Resume, finally. That button was left empty for a long time!!

2.2: Small update, added the Google Clone Projects, which is built with SASS, also tweaked some styling in the skills section.

2.5: Fairly a big update, I finally got my personal domain, kkasbarian.com, set it to my personal portfolio website, changed some Google related features to adapt to the new domain, changed the links throughout the site to the new domain and updated the site description.

2.6: A small update, added many projects on my portfolio to showcase my work!

2.8: Another small one, changed my About bio pic.

3.0: A **Big** update, I redesigned the site, picked one accent color throughout the site, changed the banner content and made it more minimal and to the point, added some nice touch to the about section, added many skills and new services, made slight changes to the portfolio section, changed the design and layout of the contact form and also changed the colors of the footer. As a bonus, I removed the random page, which was too nooby to be honest!! Made some slight changes and updated to the privacy and credits pages and some more...

3.1: Small one, added FreeCodeCamp's challenges in my Portfolio section, which links to a README, a site for that should be available soon.

3.2: Small update, added a CTA before the footer to hire me on Upwork for freelance projects! Cool idea eh?!
