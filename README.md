1.5v: Fifth Update to the Site, A Huge Update, where I changed the Form Submission Request from Formspree to a better and convenient option which doesn't even need a server or backend to be used. There is also an AJAX Response when a Form is Submitted (So No Redirects) and finally, Spam prevention is (hopefully) there too.
